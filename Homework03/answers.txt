3.2.1 The optimal tree depth seems to be around 5. In some occasions depth 6 is better, but eventually the optimal
error percentage is the same as the depth 5 error percentage.

Even after a few new random splits the optimal depth is 5.

3.2.2 The optimal tree depth also seems to be 5. In this case there are less bumps after the first optimal depth.
